# Charmed Ory Kratos

## Description

This repository hosts the Kubernetes Python Operator for Ory Kratos -  an API-first identity and user management system.
For more details, visit https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/ory-kratos-intro

## Usage

The Kratos Operator may be deployed using the Juju command line as follows:

```bash
juju deploy postgresql-k8s --channel edge --trust
juju deploy kratos
juju integrate kratos postgresql-k8s
```

To set the smtp connection uri, do:

```bash
juju config kratos smtp_connection_uri={smtp_connection_uri}
```

### Interacting with Kratos API

Below are two examples of the API. Visit [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/reference/api) to see full API specification.

#### Create Identity
```bash
curl <kratos-service-ip>:4434/identities \
--request POST -sL \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "schema_id": "default",
  "traits": {
    "email": "test@example.org"
  }
}'
```
#### Get Identities
```bash
curl <kratos-service-ip>:4434/admin/identities
```
You should be able to see the identity created earlier.

## Relations

### PostgreSQL

This charm requires a relation with [postgresql-k8s-operator](https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-k8s-operator).

### Ingress

The Kratos Operator offers integration with the [traefik-k8s-operator](https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator) for ingress. Kratos has two APIs which can be exposed through ingress, the public API and the admin API.

If you have a traefik deployed and configured in your kratos model, to provide ingress to the admin API run:
```console
juju integrate traefik-admin kratos:admin-ingress
```

To provide ingress to the public API run:
```console
juju integrate traefik-public kratos:public-ingress
```

### External Provider Relation

Kratos can be used as an identity broker. To connect Kratos with an external identity provider you can use the external provider relation. All you need to do is deploy the [kratos-external-idp-integrator](https://charmhub.io/kratos-external-idp-integrator), configure it and relate it to Kratos:

```console
juju deploy kratos-external-provider-integrator
juju config kratos-external-provider-integrator \
    client_id={client_id} \
    client_secret={client_secret} \
    provider={provider}
juju integrate kratos-external-provider-integrator kratos
```

Once kratos has registered the provider, you will be able to retrieve the redirect_uri from the integrator by running:
```console
juju run {external_provider_integrator_unit_name} get-redirect-uri --wait
```

### Hydra

This charm offers integration with [hydra-operator](https://github.com/canonical/hydra-operator).

In order to integrate kratos with hydra, it needs to be able to access hydra's admin API endpoint.
To enable that, relate the two charms:
```console
juju integrate kratos hydra
```

For further guidance on integration on hydra side, visit the [hydra-operator](https://github.com/canonical/hydra-operator#readme) repository.

### Identity Platform Login UI

The following instructions assume that you have deployed `traefik-admin` and `traefik-public` charms and related them to Kratos. Note that the UI charm should run behind a proxy.

This charm offers integration with [identity-platform-login-ui-operator](https://github.com/canonical/identity-platform-login-ui-operator). In order to integrate them, run:

```console
juju integrate kratos:ui-endpoint-info identity-platform-login-ui-operator:ui-endpoint-info
juju integrate identity-platform-login-ui-operator:kratos-endpoint-info kratos:kratos-endpoint-info
```

## Actions

The kratos charm offers the following actions:

### create-admin-account

This action can be used to create an admin account:

```console
juju run kratos/0 create-admin-account username=admin123 password=abc123456 email=admin@example.com
```

NOTE: The email registered for an admin account must not be used for any other user (admin or not).

### get-identity

This action can be used to get information about an existing identity by email or id:

By id:
```console
juju run kratos/0 get-identity identity-id={identity_id}
```

By email:
```console
juju run kratos/0 get-identity email={email}
```

### delete-identity

This action can be used to delete an existing identity:

An identity_id can be used to specify the identity:
```console
juju run kratos/0 delete-identity identity-id={identity_id}
```

An email can be used to specify the identity as well:
```console
juju run kratos/0 delete-identity email={email}
```

### run-migration

This action can be used to trigger a database migration:

```console
juju run kratos/0 run-migration
```
